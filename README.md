# KNoWS Monthly Query Research Updates

The [KNoWS research group](https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/) at Ghent University
presents monthly query research updates.

The goal of these updates is to share the research we have ongoing
across the different people (~6) working on query-related topics.
These research topics are related to improving the way we query over Web-based decentralized environments,
with SPARQL, RDF, Solid, and more.
It allows researchers to **share recent developments**, **discuss open challenges**, and **announce research results** to a wider audience.

The target audience of this channel consists of other researchers in related domains,
but also the wider public that are interested in this field for non-research aims.

## üß© Format

Within every progress update, each KNoWS researcher has a 5-minute slot to present the overall research goal,
achievements from the previous month, and goals for the next month.
After each researcher, we have a brief group discussion among all participants.
Sometimes, guests may also be invited for presenting or contributing to discussions.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to watch

The monthly updates are livestreamed to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KNoWS-UGent).
All recordings are kept available for future reference in this YouTube channel.

## üìÖ Schedule

Updates will be held every two months on the last Tuesday of the month at 9:30 (Brussels time).

The next update will take place on **September 24 2024 at 9:30 (Brussels time)**.

## üí° Topics

The following researchers are scheduled to present their topics every month:

* Ruben Eschauzier - Personalized query optimization in link traversal query processing
* Elias Crum - Storing and querying personal genome data in decentralized environments
* Jonni Hanski - Looking into applying adaptive query processing techniques in link traversal
* Maarten Vandenbrande - Optimizing decentralized querying using solid-aggregators via incremental processing
* Bryan-Elliott Tam - Optimizing Link Traversal querying using explicit data publication structures
* Ruben Taelman - Management + ensuring software architectures meet the requirements of our long-term research questions

## üì¨ Organization

These sessions are organized by [Ruben Taelman](https://www.rubensworks.net/) (Ghent University - imec) and colleagues.
